				<h1><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>H</strong>ello, I am Swapnil Prakash Shrestha and I am 21 years old. I am a student of
					BCS and currently studying in Texas International.
					Talking about my goals, I want to become an ethical hacker and bring
					some changes in this society. After I have completed my A-levels,
					I realized how much I had left to learn and started a curve
					of learning. A traditional education had given me specialized
					knowledge but hadn't set me up with the skills needed to succeed
					in an environment of constant changes.
					<br>So I set out on a journey to answer the question:<br>
				</p>
				<p><strong>"What knowledge and skills do I need to thrive in the 21st century?"</strong></p>

					As a student i don’t have experience of working in a cubical yet but, I am planning to start to
					do an Internship soon. During my high school years
					I provided 200 hour of social service in Orchid Garden Nepal. The sole purpose of the Orchid
					Garden Nepal (OGN) is to provide care and a quality
					education for all who came there. Talking about my skills, I have completed few online courses
					and have knowledge on various topics like HTML, CSS,
					C language, basic of JavaScript and so on. Some certification that i have earned in the process
					are listed below-

			<h1><a name="more" id="more"></a> About me</h1>
			<p>
				If someone told me to describe me i would describe myself as</br><i> “I feel that his approach to life
					is autonomous and individualistic.
					He does not hesitate sharing his own ideas or thoughts in a confident
					way, and when a situation asks for it, he is concerned of focusing on
					it. Many people may consider him as an interesting, unpredictable,
					somewhat impulsive person. People may say that he is a good leader,
					who makes decisions immediately, but not always the best one. I can
					say that he is audacious and courageous. He is a person who tries
					something once in his life because he takes risks and loves an
					adventure. Because of the high level of enthusiasm he depicts,
					people love to be in his company.”</i>
